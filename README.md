# Diabetes-Risk-Assessment-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
This project describes a bioinformatics-based pipeline aimed at predicting the risk of diabetes using a machine learning approach. The goal of this analysis is to identify individuals who may be at risk of developing diabetes based on various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more. The pipeline focuses on data preprocessing, training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and identifying important risk factors.

# Key Objectives
Preprocessing the diabetes dataset to ensure high data quality and handle missing values.

Developing and evaluating different machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.

Feature selection to identify the most influential factors in determining diabetes risk.

Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models.

Visualization and interpretation of the results to provide insights into diabetes risk prediction.

# Pipeline Stages and Tools
1. Data Preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
The dataset is loaded using Pandas for manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations. The first step involves checking for missing values and replacing or removing them using imputation methods. Categorical variables, such as 'gender', are encoded using LabelEncoder from sklearn, and numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scaling for all features.

2. Data Splitting and Model Selection (Sklearn)
The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. For model selection, various machine learning models are tested, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

These models are evaluated based on their ability to predict whether an individual has diabetes.

3. Model Training and Evaluation (Sklearn)
Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, and their performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Cross-validation is also performed using cross_val_score to evaluate model performance more robustly across different splits of the data.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
To improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV. This method performs an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of parameters for each model. The tuned models are then re-evaluated on the test set to assess their performance.

5. Feature Importance (RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
Using the RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier, feature importance is assessed to determine which variables contribute most to predicting diabetes risk. This information is useful for understanding which factors should be monitored closely in diabetes prevention and management.

6. Results Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
After model evaluation, performance metrics are visualized using matplotlib and seaborn. This includes confusion matrices, ROC curves, and bar plots showing feature importance. These visualizations help in better understanding model performance and risk factor analysis.

# Results and Findings
The models performed well, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showing the highest accuracy and ability to identify diabetic individuals.

Feature importance analysis highlighted key risk factors such as BMI, glucose levels, and age, which strongly influence the likelihood of diabetes.

Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved model performance, with Gradient Boosting achieving the best results in terms of precision and recall.
